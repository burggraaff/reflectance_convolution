This code was used for my paper ["Biases from incorrect reflectance convolution"](https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.391470). There are scripts to process PANGAEA/SeaBASS data to a standardised format, perform spectral convolution in two ways (the incorrect method of reflectance space, and the correct method of radiance space), and analyse and plot the results.

Some of this code is being moved to the [SPECTACLE module](https://github.com/monocle-h2020/camera_calibration) and will soon be available from there.
